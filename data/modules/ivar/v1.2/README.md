## iVar trim log file generated from stdout so dont have a standard naming convention

```bash
ivar trim \
    -i sample1.mapped.bam \
    -e \
    -b nCoV-2019.artic.V1.bed \
    -p sample1.trim > sample1.trim.ivar.log
```

### Test files added

`sample1.trim.ivar.log` (iVar v1.2)

## ivar variant log file

Doesn't have a standard naming convention either, `sample1_pe_ivar_variants.tsv` for testing purposes added.
